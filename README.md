#### FAQ:
1. "Is this compatible with mod xyz?"  
_Probably! - TerraForged is designed to work with many of the same world-gen systems that the majority  
of block & biome providing mods use. Certain biomes' terrain may not always look exactly as their  
author designed but should otherwise be compatible._

2. "Can I use this on a server?"  
_Yes absolutely! - Either create the world initially in single player and thrn copy it to your server  
directory, or you can use my mod [PreGenForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pregenforge) and add level-type=terraforged to the overrides.properties  
file it creates in the root of your server folder._
