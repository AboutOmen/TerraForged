#### FAQ:
1. "Is this compatible with mod xyz?"  
_Probably! (to some degree) - TerraForged is designed to work with many of the same world-gen systems
that the majority of block & biome providing mods use. Certain biomes' terrain may not always look
exactly as their author designed but should otherwise be compatible. Feel free to report any other
compatibility issues on the issue tracker_

2. "How can I use this on my server?"  
_When Forge supports it, you can simply set level-type=terraforged in your server.properties file. In
the meantime, you will need to create the world in single player and then copy that to your server
directory. (In both cases, TerraForged must be installed on the client and the server)._

3. "Will I need a super-computer to run this?!"
_No, not really - while this world generator will be a bit slower than vanilla's (on account of it
doing more work to make things look nice), it would only be apparent when first generating a chunk
- they might load in slower when moving to new parts of the world, but game performance should
otherwise be normal. A 4-core CPU should be able to handle this just fine._
